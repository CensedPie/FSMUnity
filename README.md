# FSMUnity
A FSM pattern implemented in Unity.

Some extra files might be required but those are simple things like a progress bar.
Assets such as graphics are not included in this repo. This is purely for educational purposes.
It is meant to serve as a guide to how to implement your own FSM not as a standalone asset.
